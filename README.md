# ✨**Libft**✨

Here we are! The very first project of the commoen core :)  <br />
This project is basically making your first own library "Libft". You will reproduce many functions in this project, <br />
and will be able to use this labrary in your future project! (so you better make it beautiful XD) <br />
I highly recomend you to do the bonuses in which you will learn about the linked chain and the structures. It seems <br />
a bit complicated at first but you will use these in your future project so it is better for you to understand it now! <br />
